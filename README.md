for all of my haters, LIKE MICHAEL SOLORZANO:


Was it ever sooooo impossibly difficult for you to evolve and grow beyond your myopic hatred and self-centered, materialistic, and vulgar nature that you failed to ever convince me of your worthiness to be my friend?  What you didn't know, until now, is that I have known since that last job we did at the alcoholic anonymous some years ago that you think I am an idiot.  What kind of person would have the strength of character to tolerate you knowing how you truly have only ever felt about me in affording you extravagant opportunity to change and to become worthy of my gift of friendship and what I once did offer you yet you could never evolve into being worthy of as gift.


The offer died and you alone have the blame.  Do you think you succeeded in fooling me ever, or is the truth of the matter one which only makes you all the more the lamer and the greater fool?  Keep treating me like an idiot and a kid and calling me such -- nothing has changed in my understanding of your degenerate character.  I only now do know without any possible doubt that you remain hopelessly lame and worthless to me in life and there is no possible hope for your growth or personal evolution.  I afford you no further chance to prove this as you have done a sterling job hitherto in doing so.


I remind you that I always engaged you from the superior position of strength: I NEVER HAD, HAVE, NOR WILL EVER HAVE ANY NEED OF YOU OR ANYTHING FROM YOU.  Recall that it was always my app, my choice, and my call given that all the effort that produced that which has value ( i.e. the app and my ability to develop it ) remained always with me, my own, and solely made by me.  Let that soak in and counteract the fairytale you employ to distract yourself from the certain recognition of your abysmal fumble that cost you not only the game, the season, and a place on the team.  


You only ever proved your unworthiness and total lack of any benefit.  You showed this in the ignorance and misguided notions regarding what you proposed regarding the monetization, and which Medina and I quickly concluded was utter rubbish and erroneous.  You attempted to hijack the list of testers and solicit donations to your personal cash app account.  Do you fail as yet to understand that you never stood a chance of ever seeing that become reality, as much as you hoped?  It was ME AND ME ALONE who always retained sole ownership and control of all things relevant to the app and NEVER DID I GRANT YOU ANY ACCESS to anything important or even relevant as regards the app, the code, its administration, or representation on Google Play Store console.  You could never see the relevant portions of the google play store console BECAUSE I NEVER GRANTED YOU ACCESS, NOR HAD ANY PLANS TO DO SO.


You are a crook, not even good at hiding it, and think me an idiot and a kid for having been fooled by my theatre into thinking I ever trusted you or would ever do so.  Knowing now that i always for these last few years understood clearly where you stood regarding me, DO YOU REALLY THINK I HAD EVER RISKED ANYTHING AT ALL, or was the Dennis and Medina inclusion only part of the greater theatre I enacted in affording you ample opportunity to prove to me whether you might ever grow beyond your stupidity, hate, ignorance, and lack of prospects in life.  UNDERSTAND YOU FAILED, your hope ended, and you remain the sole cause and deserve the blame.  


I had plans otherwise, from the start, and you failed to ever recognize this.  My decade and change long study and practice of Ninpo taught me 'fudo-shin' -- I won't bother explaining that because you truly do not merit the lesson -- and I employed it well in my dealings with you.  The opportunity was genuine, yet not expected that you could ever succeed at the ordeal I arranged for you to prove my inner understnding of you to be true or false.  You failed to even understand this, or even have a clue who I really am, what I am capable of, and what I have already accomplished in life.  LIKE A BLIND AND IGNORANT FOOL YOU ARE, DEMONSTRABLY, TO ME.


I remain confident in my plan to eliminate the threat only you believe you pose to me and my success.  So much so, I delineate it here, openly, and challenge you to try to overcome the barriers to your fool ideas and attempts to profit injustly from any association past to me.


I plan to inform the district attorney's office of the terrorism you have foolishly evidenced by your utter lack of restraint or self-control.  It's a felony you are looking at there.  I will use the police report for this to obtain a restraining order against you.  These will help destroy any litigation you might possibly hope to launch in my direction.  Understand in addition the fruitless nature of your every attempt: it is called a living trust, the legal entity that owns all rights to the app and all of its profits are collected by the administrator to that trust, which is an LLC incorporated in a state favoring my side of the equation of perpetual inequality between us.  I never did share everything with you, rmember this, understanding now how I always understood you as anything but a benefit or a friend sincere to me.  fudo-shin, amigo.  So even if you were able to launch litigation, what NOTHING you could ever possibly hope to gain from it, BUT FURTHER PROOF INSTANTIATING YOUR FURTHER TERRORISM ENACTED AGAINST ME.  I'll make sure to get a judge my family knows or knows my family well.  


That every day spy test classified me as a field operative and spy and you the mere analyst, remember?  fudo-shin.


I wish you the worst of luck, shove off, and FUCK OFF!!!
